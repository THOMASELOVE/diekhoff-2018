# Diekhoff 2018

![](DiekhoffArticle_Daily_2018-05-09_1.PNG)

I received the 2018 John S. Diekhoff Award for Graduate Teaching at CWRU.

- **Article** The CWRU Daily produced a [very kind article about me and this award](http://thedaily.case.edu/incredible-educator-medicines-thomas-love-wins-diekhoff-award-graduate-teaching/), and a [PDF of the article is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/diekhoff-2018/blob/master/Diekhoff_text_TheDaily_2018-05-09.pdf)
- **Audio Recording** A student of mine (Ryan Honomichl) was good enough to record Provost Bud Baeslack and the many other people who busted into my class on April 6, 2018 to announce that I had won the award. A [seven-minute audio clip from that recording is here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/diekhoff-2018/master/Surprised_Diekhoff_Award_TEL_432_2018-04-06.mp3) if you want to hear me overwhelmed and tongue-tied.
